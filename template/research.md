#### Motion Planning

Motion planning is used in robotics for finding a sequence of valid configurations that moves the robot from the source to a destination.

>[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00192.pdf "Combined Task and Motion Planning for a Dual-arm Robot to Use a Suction Cup Tool") proposes a combined task and motion planner for a dual-arm robot to use a suction cup tool. The planner consists of three sub-planners â€“ A suction pose subplanner and two regrasp and motion sub-planners. The suction pose sub-planner finds all the available poses for a suction cup tool to suck on the object, using the models of the tool and the object. The regrasp and motion sub-planner builds the regrasp graph that represents all possible grasp sequences to reorient and move the suction cup tool from an initial pose to a goal pose. Two regrasp graphs are used to plan for a single suction cup and the complex of the suction cup and an object respectively. The output of the proposed planner is a sequence of robot motion that uses a suction cup tool to manipulate objects following human instructions. The planner is examined and analyzed by both simulation experiments and real-world executions using several real-world tasks. The results show that the planner is efficient, robust, and can generate sequential transit and transfer robot motion to finish complicated combined task and motion planning tasks in a few seconds.

#### Assembly Planning

Assembly planning is to automatically find the detailed sets of instructions for the robot to assembly the product.

>[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00699.pdf "Planning to Build Soma Blocks Using a Dual-arm Robot") presents a planner that can automatically find an optimal assembly sequence for a dual-arm robot to assemble the soma blocks. The planner uses the mesh model of objects and the final state of the assembly to generate all possible assembly sequence and evaluate the optimal assembly sequence by considering the stability, graspability, assemblability, as well as the need for a second arm. Especially, the need for a second arm is considered when supports from worktables and other workpieces are not enough to produce a stable assembly. The planner will refer to an assisting grasp to additionally hold and support the unstable components so that the robot can further assemble new workpieces and finally reach a stable state. The output of the planner is the optimal assembly orders, candidate grasps, assembly directions, and the assisting grasps if any. The output of the planner can be used to guide a dualarm robot to perform the assembly task. The planner is verified in both simulations and real-world executions.
